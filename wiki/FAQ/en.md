# FAQ

This is a list of common questions that get asked.

## What is this?

Titanic! is a private server for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh), that was designed to preserve the earlier days of the game, by letting players use clients from 2008 to 2014, as well as similar maps from that era. It's a community-driven project that is fully [open-source](https://github.com/osuTitanic), so feel free to look at the code and contribute to it.

## How can I play?

To get started you can take a look at the [[installation guide]] or just go to the [downloads page](https://osu.titanic.sh/download/) on our website.

## How do I find beatmaps?

You can download beatmaps via osu! Direct or on the [beatmaps page](https://osu.titanic.sh/beatmapsets/) on the website. Downloading maps from the offical osu! website works as well.

## My game is feeling slow/laggy, how can I fix that?

Many players sadly face this issue and most often it can be fixed by setting the `RefreshRate` value in the `osu!.yourname.cfg` file, to your monitors refresh rate. If you are still experiencing issues, please try to mess around with the graphics & fps settings, until it feels right! Other versions of the game might also give you a better or worse experience.

## Will RX/AP scores be submitted?

Yes, we do support Relax and Autopilot submission, with one noticeable difference to other servers: Ranks for Vanilla, Relax and Autopilot are merged together, since they do give PP and score, but not as much compared to Vanilla to keep things fair.

## What PP system is this?

We use a customized pp system, mostly developed by [Adachi](https://osu.titanic.sh/u/39), which changes the behavior of relax & autopilot PP and also has some changes regarding combo scaling, which makes a few misses not kill your pp. 
We also have a ["ppv1" recreation](https://osu.titanic.sh/rankings/osu/ppv1), which was meant to be a joke, but seems to be a real thing now. Please keep in mind that this is nowhere near the original ppv1 system!

## How can I submit a beatmap?

You have two options for this. Either submit one from the editor in-game, or request a map from osu.ppy.sh on the [map requests](https://osu.titanic.sh/forum/11) page on the fourms.

## Where can I report bugs or suggest features?

You can suggest features in the the [Feature Requests](https://osu.titanic.sh/forum/6) page on the forums.
To report bugs you will also need to go to the [Bug Reports](https://osu.titanic.sh/forum/18) page on the forums.

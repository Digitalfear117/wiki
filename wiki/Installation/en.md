To begin playing on Titanic! you can head over to the [downloads page](https://osu.lekuru.xyz/download/) and pick any client from as old as 2007 up to 2014.

After it finishes installing, all you have to do is extract the folder and double-click `osu!.exe`.

There is a chance that Windows Defender may block it, since the game is unsigned (a certificate for that would cost 200$).
